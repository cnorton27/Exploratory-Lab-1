{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "description": "On a local nature trail, we found a trunk of a dead tree in a small clump of western hemlock trees. A section of bark had been sliced away, exposing a dark orange inner layer. We found a living tree fallen beside it and concluded that it had torn away the bark. The living tree had some of this orange bark exposed at the roots, so we are wondering whether this shows a fungal disease. Photos show: detail of a piece of the separated bark (is that larvae in there?), the edge of the bark still on the tree, and an overview of the area where the bark was removed. We went back looking for any trace of a fruiting body and also to try to see whether this is redness is caused by exposure of bark to air." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.145835, 49.710149 ] } },
